## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile and Waterfall are two widely used software development methodologies, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. They differ in how they approach project planning, execution, and delivery.

 1. Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. The project is divided into small cycles or "sprints," each producing a working product increment. Agile is flexible and adaptive, with frequent stakeholder interaction and continuous improvement.

Key Characteristics:
- Work is divided into short, time-boxed iterations (typically 1-4 weeks).
- Frequent delivery of working software after each iteration.
- Emphasis on customer collaboration and feedback.
- Changes are embraced, even late in the development process.
- Cross-functional, self-organizing teams work together.

Advantages of Agile:
1. Flexibility: Agile can easily accommodate changes in requirements, making it ideal for projects with evolving needs.
2. Customer Collaboration:Continuous stakeholder feedback ensures that the product meets customer needs and expectations.
3. Faster Delivery: Frequent releases of working software enable quicker delivery of parts of the product, which can be used or reviewed sooner.
4. Risk Management: Early identification and resolution of issues help in mitigating risks.
5. Improved Quality: Regular testing during each sprint ensures higher quality by identifying issues early.

Disadvantages of Agile:
1. Scope Creep: The flexibility to change requirements can lead to uncontrolled scope changes, potentially derailing the project.
2. Resource Intensive: Agile requires continuous involvement from stakeholders, which can be demanding and time-consuming.
3. Documentation Challenges: Agile's focus on working software over comprehensive documentation may lead to insufficient documentation, making it hard to track progress or maintain the project long-term.
4. Team Dependency:Agile requires highly skilled and self-organizing teams. If the team isn't effective, it can negatively impact project success.


2. Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It follows a structured flow where each phase (e.g., requirements gathering, design, development, testing) is completed before moving on to the next one.

Key Characteristics:
- Phases are completed sequentially with little overlap.
- Requires a detailed upfront plan with well-defined requirements.
- Limited flexibility for changes once a phase is completed.
- Testing happens after the development phase is complete.

Advantages of Waterfall:
1. Clear Structure:The sequential approach provides a clear, structured process that is easy to understand and manage.
2. Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation is created at each phase, which can be beneficial for future maintenance or reference.
3. Predictability:Because of its structured nature, Waterfall can offer predictable timelines and budgets when requirements are clear and stable.
4. Simplicity:Waterfall is straightforward and works well for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements.

Disadvantages of Waterfall:
1. Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed, changes are difficult to incorporate, which can be problematic if new insights or requirements arise.
2. Late Testing: Testing only happens after the development phase, which can lead to discovering issues late in the process, making it harder and more expensive to fix.
3. High Risk of Failure:Since requirements are defined upfront, any misunderstanding of the requirements early on can lead to costly mistakes.
4. Slow Feedback:There is minimal customer interaction during the development process, which can result in misalignment with user needs by the time the product is delivered.
